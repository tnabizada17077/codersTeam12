                This website is dedicated to the Team 12. As a homework we had to create our own website from the scratch using HTML,
                CSS, and JS. <br>Then we joined all our work into one and that website came to life. We developed
                this site using Git.

                In this web creation project/ homework, we learned the basics of languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also liked this 
                activity because it made us learn and discover things that most probably by ourselves never would do that.
                We were given two weeks to do this project and for our opinion, we did a very good job. Hope you enjoy it! Thanks!
